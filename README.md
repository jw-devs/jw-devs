JW-devs website
----------------------

[This](jw-devs.link) is a website dedicated to [Jehovah's Witnesses](http://jw.org)
who are interested in developing technology for the sake of the kingdom.

If you are a witness and a developer you probably developed tools (or tried to)
with the goal of making your ministry easier. Or perhaps you have an idea but
do not have the time or skills to build such tools. Here is the place where you
can find skilled brothers and sisters to collaborate on your project or your
idea.

[Here](https://github.com/orgs/jw-devs/people) you can find a list of JW developers.
